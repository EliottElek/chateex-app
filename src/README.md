### Message reaction

You can add reaction to any messages you want, and with any emoji you want. When you add a reaction to a message in a chat group, others can also add a reaction to that same message. When you decide to add a reaction to that message again, it will overwrite the previous one. You can also remove your reaction at any moment.

By default, when creating an account, the app will set your avatar as your gravatar. You can change it whenever your want, with a picture you uploaded or you can choose between our vast selection of avatars.

### Administrator rights and private conversations

When you create a chat group, you become the administator of the group. You can add and remove people, change the name and picture of the channel and delete it. When you're invited to a group, you can only view people and leave the channel. When you create a private conversation (only two people), it will first check if you already have a conversation witht this person, and will redirect you to this conversation if it exists, or create one if it doesn't.

(Administrator on the left, guest on the right)

### Account registration 

You have the choice to either create an account directly through our registration form (http://localhost:3000/register) or register/login with another application (github).
When you log in with another application, the app will check for the account linked to your email address. If no account is found, it will create the account with your github username, email and gravatar.

### Account deletion

You can delete your acount at any time you want.
